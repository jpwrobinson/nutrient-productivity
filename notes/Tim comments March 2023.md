Nutrient productivity

One thread of thoughts is that you are just looking at fish species but  the language makes it sound like the whole ecosystem or fisheries  production. I suggest you be clearer about the small scale or focus on  fish species.  Future work may want to look at fisheries production  and whole ecosystem change. 

 Read these two papers and you will better understand my larger perspective.

 McClanahan TR. 1992. Resource utilization, competition, and predation: A model and example from coral reef grazers. Ecological Modelling  61:195-215.

 McClanahan TR, Graham NAJ, MacNeil MA, Muthiga NA, Cinner JE, Bruggemann JH, Wilson SK. 2011. Critical thresholds and tangible targets for  ecosystem-based management of coral reef fisheries. Proceedings of the  National Academy of Sciences 108:17230-17233.

Isn't one of the main findings that nutrient production and growth and  therefore production are not well coupled. Thus, the idea that having  low biomass, high turnover fisheries is not really a good idea for  getting nutrition? This is how I interpret the findings and yet this  main message is lost in the text that creates an expectation that they  should be coupled and then seems to lack a strong statement about this  failure. Given this the failure to be coupled is important for fisheries policy, it seems you need to make a stronger statement about the poor  relationship. In many ways you have falsified this idea. 

The other policy message is about the value of herbivorous fish. There  is a long line of papers about protecting herbivorous fish for reef  ecology and yet here you say they are the most nutritious. So, if there  is a nutrition-oriented policy, then we should be overfishing  herbivorous fish to get nutrients. The text avoids any discussion of  this potential conflict or trade off. 

The Ecological Indicators is a large compilation for the WIO (2019). This LH  approach does suggest higher growth and mortality at low biomass. In  the F&F paper (2018), I argue the effect is small on catch rates. So, there may be a disconnect between LH and catch predictions. I also see the  Siguen 2022 paper as also largely supporting the lack of high production / low biomass in coral reefs. Seems high production is more common in  intermediate biomass sites. Thus, nutrient yields would be near MSY as  we point out in our gated trap study or ERL2002 paper. 

 So while it is logical to think that low biomass and size of fish may  produce higher nutrient yields, this will seldom be the case based on  studies to date. Your paper is a good opportunity to falsify this  conjecture and should be the core message. I don't see this very clearly in the current version. 

Kmax needs to be better defined. It is a growth of a species but it is not clear if this represents a net or gross production.

I think you have to address some of the debate around nutrition more directly, such as this debate. 

 Tilley A, Mills D, Short R, Kolding J. 2020. Valuing small fish from  mosquito nets: A comment on Jones & Unsworth (2019). Ambio  49:1268-1270.

 Then the herbivore debate - food vs reef function. Certainly, including  these two debates more explicitly will make the paper clearer in terms  of relevance to policy, which is what you should aim for with these  letter type papers.
